# Arrays (DSA with Java)

This folder contains several Java solutions and practice programs for array problems (searching, sorting, two-dimensional arrays, etc.).

Files include:
- Various sorting algorithms (bubbleSort, selectionSort, insertionSort, countingSort)
- Search algorithms (linearSearch, binarySearch)
- Array problems and utilities (kadanesAlgo, trappingRainwater, printSpiral, etc.)

How to add to GitHub (once Git is installed):
1. Initialize repo: `git init`
2. Add files: `git add .`
3. Commit: `git commit -m "Initial commit: add Java array solutions"`
4. Create remote and push (using `gh`): `gh repo create <repo-name> --public --source . --remote origin --push` or add a remote manually and `git push -u origin main`.

If you want, I can continue and run the git/github commands once you have Git (and optionally `gh`) installed and give me permission to proceed.
